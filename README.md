# Run Management System

## Overview
This is a simple application that I build following a course to get up to date with Spring Boot.
I tested it with: 
- **InMemoryRepository**
- **H2 InMemoryRepository**:
- **JDBC API**
- **Spring Data JDBC**
- **Spring Data JPA**

For the database I used both a PostgresSQL image in Docker Desktop and the PostgresSQL server on Windows.

I also learned how to:
- **Use the RestClient**
- **Use the HTTP Client interface**:
- **Test the application using JUnit and Mockito**
- **Configure the compose.yaml file to use Docker**
